üìä Data Analyst Job Analysis üìä

In this project, I worked on analyzing job data for the role of Data Analyst. Here's a brief overview of the code:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Imported Libraries: I utilized the NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly Express libraries to perform data analysis and visualization.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Loaded the Data: I loaded the job data from a CSV file called 'DataAnalyst.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis: I explored the loaded data to gain insights into various job attributes such as job titles, salary estimates, job descriptions, ratings, company information, locations, and more.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization: I used Plotly Express to create interactive visualizations, allowing for a clear understanding of the data and its patterns.

By analyzing this data, I gained valuable insights into the data analyst job market, including salary ranges, popular job titles, and companies hiring for these roles. This analysis can help professionals in the data analysis field make informed decisions about their career paths and job search strategies.

I enjoyed working on this project, and it has further strengthened my skills in data analysis and visualization. If you're interested in learning more about this project or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
